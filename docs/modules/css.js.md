TODO / AND WILL BE RE-WRITTEN FROM SCRATCH. very soon..

# css.js

See `css.js` and `css.matrix.js`.. the first one is implementing the base, to handle CSS on my own
(I'll be using this as some 'pre-processor' or so in the future); it became necessary due to some
other extensions, like `..getVariable()` etc..
