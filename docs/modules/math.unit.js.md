# math.unit.js

The 'math.unit.js' is for converting/parsing/rendering/.. file sizes or time durations, etc. It can convert size strings (MiB, mb,
..) to their byte count, or such to any size/unit (automatically recognized or manually defined). It can create a table{} of both,
absolute and relative parts of such numbers (like system/radix conversion), or render some times to a string/text form, or bring
them to a table{} form of absolute and/or relative [ day{,s}, month{,s}, minute{,s}, ... ].

Is being improved from time to time.
