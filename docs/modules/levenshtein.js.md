# levenshtein.js

Calculation of word distances, regularily used to suggest nearest commands from a wrong command input.. also supports case-insensitive.
Just define the input word plus a list of all available commands (if you don't use it for other reasons), maybe also max. two boolean
types (to define CASE_SENSITIVE or WITH_DISTANCES = [] result, not only the words).
