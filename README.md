## Issues

### Performance
Currently the performance is somewhat going down when playing
around with the animated menu bar.. goin' to fix it soon. ^_^

## Next steps

#### Sneak preview in your browser
As everything important is uploaded right now, I'm just missing
a web link for a sneak preview.. this is what I'm going to do next.. ^_^

#### Responsible Design
That's how I want to design everything, to get it more 'responsible', too. Automatically align/size
everything, also for small, mobile web browsers.. see the following example link (just for my TODO)

Something like [https://chriscoyier.net/2023/04/11/expanding-grid-cards-with-view-transitions/]..

The plan was to use a '*box*.js' (which is already there, btw), but planned to be used like regular
windows on your PC.. so that's not the final plan, as it's not so beautiful on mobile browsers. And
currently there are, btw, also '/**responsible**/.css', but they are going to be optimized as well.
