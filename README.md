## Issues

### Performance
Currently the performance is somewhat going down when playing
around with the animated menu bar.. goin' to fix it soon. ^_^

## Next steps

#### Responsible Design
That's how I want to design everything, to get it more 'responsible', too. Automatically align/size
everything, also for small, mobile web browsers.. see the following example link (just for my TODO)

Something like [https://chriscoyier.net/2023/04/11/expanding-grid-cards-with-view-transitions/]..

The plan was to use a '*box*.js' (which is already there, btw), but planned to be used like regular
windows on your PC.. so that's not the final plan, as it's not so beautiful on mobile browsers. And
currently there are, btw, also '/**responsible**/.css', but they are going to be optimized as well.

### Bionic Reading
As this is just integrated in *my own implementation*, this is just to read a bit 'bout it (you can
see it when you click on a menu item, where the 'lorem ipsum' text appears. :)~
